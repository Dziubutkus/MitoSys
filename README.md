# MitoSys

Subscription solution providing free access to users and generating interest for developers.

### Description
The MitoSYS platform aims to capitalize on people who are not willing to pay for the content they wish to access.  Our system provides a subscription layer that can be easily attached to any platform to allow free access to users while generating revenue for content creators or developers.  We acomplish this goal by allowing subscribers to purchace a subscription token from the contract for a service.  This non-fungible token(NFT) allows access to a service for the entirety of time that it is owned.  The DAI that is used to purchace the NFT is then put into the Compound network where it will generate interest.  This interest will go directly to the developer/content creator.  Whenever the user desires, they may burn their NFT and recieve the full value they payed for it.  This provides an effectively free subscription service that will generate revenue for the content creator.
